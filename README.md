# Active Effects Mod for DaggerFall Unity

Adds the diseases/poisons your character is currently affected by to the HUD.

## Description

Messages for currently contracted ailments are displayed at the top left of the HUD.

Both ailments require a set amount of incubation time before they'll manifest. This mod will add unique messages for incubation and manifested versions like so:

### Diseases
* Incubating: *$1 is slowly creeping over you*
* Manifested: *You have contracted $1*

### Poison
* Incubating: *$1 is slowly seeping through your veins*
* Manifested: *You have $1 coursing through your veins*

## Installation

* Copy the `.dfmod` for your OS of choice to your DFU installations *StreamingAssets\Mods* folder.
